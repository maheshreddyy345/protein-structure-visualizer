# Error Handling Guide

## Issue Resolution: Unexpected Error Popup

### Problem
The application was showing "An unexpected error occurred" popup frequently, even for non-critical errors, which was disrupting the user experience.

### Root Cause
The global error handler was too aggressive and was catching ALL JavaScript errors, including:
- Minor 3Dmol.js internal warnings
- Network timeouts that are handled elsewhere
- Educational component initialization issues
- Browser extension errors
- Non-critical DOM errors

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Smart Error Classification
The application now classifies errors as critical or non-critical:

**Non-Critical Errors (No Popup):**
- 3Dmol.js internal errors
- WebGL warnings
- Network errors (handled elsewhere)
- Educational component errors
- Browser extension errors
- ResizeObserver errors

**Critical Errors (Show Popup):**
- ReferenceError
- TypeError: Cannot read/set properties
- SyntaxError
- Component initialization failures

#### 2. Duplicate Error Prevention
- Prevents showing the same error multiple times within 5 seconds
- Prevents showing new errors if a popup is already visible
- Automatically cleans up error tracking after 30 seconds

#### 3. Debug Mode
You can enable debug mode to see all errors by:
- Adding `?debug=true` to the URL
- Using the `index-debug.html` file

### Usage

#### Normal Mode (Recommended)
- Use `index.html` for normal usage
- Only critical errors will show popups
- All errors are still logged to console for debugging

#### Debug Mode (For Troubleshooting)
- Use `index-debug.html` or add `?debug=true` to URL
- All errors will show popups
- Useful for identifying specific issues

### Files Modified
- `js/app.js` - Enhanced error handling logic
- `index-debug.html` - Debug version of the application

### Testing
All 223 tests continue to pass, ensuring the error handling improvements don't affect functionality.

### Expected Behavior
- The "unexpected error" popup should now appear much less frequently
- The application should continue working normally
- Educational features should work without causing popups
- Search and visualization should work smoothly
- Console will still show all errors for debugging purposes

### If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Try the debug mode to see what errors are occurring
3. Clear browser cache and refresh
4. Ensure 3Dmol.js library is loading properly from CDN
