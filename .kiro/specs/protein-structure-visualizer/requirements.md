# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Protein Structure Visualizer is a web application that allows users to explore protein structures from the AlphaFold database. This tool will help beginners understand how to access AlphaFold's predicted protein structures, visualize them in 3D, and learn about the relationship between protein sequences and their predicted structures. The application focuses on making protein structure data accessible and understandable for educational purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a biology student, I want to search for proteins by their common name or UniProt ID, so that I can easily find the protein structures I'm interested in studying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a protein name in the search field THEN the system SHALL query the AlphaFold database API to find matching proteins
2. WHEN a user enters a valid UniProt ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve the corresponding protein structure data
3. WHEN the search returns multiple results THEN the system SHALL display a list of matching proteins with their basic information
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL display a clear "no results found" message
5. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view basic information about a selected protein, so that I can understand what protein I'm looking at and its biological significance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a protein from search results THEN the system SHALL display the protein's name, UniProt ID, and organism
2. WHEN protein information is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the protein's sequence length and confidence score
3. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL display a brief description of the protein's function
4. WHEN the protein data is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
5. IF protein information cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visualize the 3D structure of a protein, so that I can understand how the protein folds and see its spatial arrangement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a protein is selected THEN the system SHALL fetch the PDB structure file from AlphaFold database
2. WHEN the structure data is loaded THEN the system SHALL render a 3D visualization of the protein
3. WHEN viewing the 3D structure THEN the user SHALL be able to rotate, zoom, and pan the visualization
4. WHEN displaying the structure THEN the system SHALL color-code regions by confidence level (high, medium, low confidence)
5. WHEN the structure file is large THEN the system SHALL show loading progress
6. IF the structure cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the 3D protein structure, so that I can explore different parts of the protein and understand its structural features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a 3D structure THEN the user SHALL be able to switch between different visualization styles (cartoon, surface, stick)
2. WHEN hovering over parts of the structure THEN the system SHALL display information about that region
3. WHEN the user clicks on a specific amino acid THEN the system SHALL highlight that residue and show its details
4. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL provide controls to show/hide different structural elements
5. WHEN the visualization is complex THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance during interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a beginner, I want to understand what I'm looking at in the protein structure, so that I can learn about protein folding and structural biology concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a protein structure THEN the system SHALL provide explanatory tooltips for key structural features
2. WHEN confidence scores are displayed THEN the system SHALL explain what these scores mean
3. WHEN different colors are used THEN the system SHALL provide a legend explaining the color coding
4. WHEN structural elements are shown THEN the system SHALL offer brief explanations of alpha helices, beta sheets, and loops
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide educational context about why certain data might be unavailable
